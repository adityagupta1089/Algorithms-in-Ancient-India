# Algorithms in Ancient India
## 1. Ghanapatha for a given input string.
To memorize slokas in ancient time people performed various recitation styles for complete and perfect memorizations, one of which is Ghanapatha. In essence it is just a permutation with repetition of words in different orders.
### How to run?
`python3 ghanapatha.py`

### Explanation

- In this problem we will first store the words of the string in an array.
- We can then see than ghanapatha is the sequence `1221123321123` repeated each time with `+1` to each term, i.e. `1221...` $\to$ `2332...`.
- So we loop through this sequence and print the corresponding word each time by an offset of `-1,0,1,2,...` (`-1` for 0-based indexing) to the numbers in the sequence until the maximum index is contained in the string.
- This means that $3+\text{offset}<\text{length}(\text {string})$

### Sample Input
```
dhiyah. yah. na pracodayﾄ》
```

### Sample Output
```
Ghanapatha for given text is:

dhiyah. yah. yah. dhiyah. dhiyah. yah. na na yah. dhiyah. dhiyah. yah. na ;
yah. na na yah. yah. na pracodayﾄ》 pracodayﾄ》 na yah. yah. na pracodayﾄ》 ;
```

## 2. Sequences of binary number using Pingala's Algorithm
An algorithm by pingala to write binary numbers with given number of digits.

### How to run?
`python3 pingala_binary_sequence.py`

### Explanation

- This problem is based on recursive algorithm where the function returns a list `[0, 1]` if $n=1$.
- Otherwise it first recurses to get list for $n=n-1$ and then for every binary string in that list, it first appends `0` to it and then finally `1` to all of them. 
- Finally it returns the constructed binary sequence (In $L\to R$ manner).

### Sample Input
```
5
```

### Sample Output
```
Binary sequence of n bits written in L-R manner is
00000
10000
01000
11000
00100
10100
01100

```

## 3. Power of 2 using Pingala's Algorithm
The famous `O(log n)` power of 2 algorithm.
### How to run?
`python3 pingala_2_pow_n.py`

### Explanation

- In this problem if $n=0$ we return `1`, else we recurse in the following manner:
	- If $2\mid n$, we return `pow(n/2)*pow(n/2)` else
	- If $2\not\mid n$, we return `pow(n-1)*2`

### Sample Input
```
123
```

### Sample Output
```
2^n using pingala's algorithm is: 10633823966279326983230456482242756608
```
## 4. Solving a linear diophantine equation by Kuttaka method
An algorithm to solve the linear diophantine equation `ax+c=by`.

### How to run?
`python kuttaka.py`

### Explanation

$$ax + c = by$$

- We first check if `gcd(a, b)` divides `c`.If gcd is `>1` Then we divide by common gcd. We make `A, B, C` as positive values of `a, b, c`
- We then create a list for quotients na dmake dividend and divisor as `A` and `B`.
- We find remainders until we get 1 and make valli.
- Finally we multiply the penultimate term with the factor above and add the next term. We expunge the last term and repeat this process till we have only 2 values in the column.
- Then we deal with special cases `a < 0`, `b < 0` and `c < 0`.
- Then we subtract `a` and `c` times the minimum dividend when dividing `y` and `x` respectively.



### Sample Run
```
ax + c = by
Enter a: 60
Enter c: 3
Enter b: 13
60 * 11 + 3 = 663 = 663 = 13 * 51
Solution is (11, 51)
```

## 5. Solving a quadratic diophantine equation by Chakravala method
Solves the quadratic Pell-like equation `Pq^2+s=r^2` through Chakravala method.
### How to run?
`python chakravala.py`

### Explanation
$$Pq^2+s=r^2$$

- We first nearest square to `P`, i.e. $\left(\text{round}(\sqrt P)\right)^2$, `r` as $P\cdot1^2+s=r^2\implies r=\sqrt{s+P}$ and $q=1$.
- Then while we get $s=\pm1,\pm2\pm4$, we solve $qx+r=sy$ (ignoring sign) using previously made kuttaka. Let us get $(x,y)$ as the solution.
- Then we will have $(x+ks,y+kq)$ as another solution, so we need to minimize $|P-X^2|=|P-(x+ks)^2|$ which is  concave, so minima will be near root, i.e. $\frac{\sqrt{P}-x}s$, so we check both integers near to this value and find required $(X, Y) = (x+ks,y+kq)$.
- Then we take $s=-\frac{X^2-P}s$ (neglecting sign) and $q=Y, r=\sqrt{Pq^2+s}$.
- Then we do bhavana, where we use the two rules:
	- Solution of $Pq^2+c=r^2$ is $(\alpha, \beta)$ then solution of $Pq^2+c/k^2=r^2$ is $(\alpha/k,\beta/k)$.
	- Solution of $Pq^2+k=r^2$ is $(\alpha, \beta)$ then solutions of $Pq^2+k^2=r^2$ is $(2\alpha\beta, P\alpha^2+\beta^2)$, or if we have another solution $(\alpha_1,\beta_1)$ then $(\alpha\beta_1+\alpha_1\beta,P\alpha\alpha_1+\beta\beta_1)$ 
	- We do the following transformations: `-1 -> 1`, `4 -> 1`, `-4 -> -1 -> 1`, `2 -> 4 -> 1`, `-2 -> 4 -> 1`.

### Sample Run
```
Pq^2 + s = r^2
Enter P: 61
Enter s: 1
61 * 226153980 ^ 2 + 1 = 3119882982860264401 = 3119882982860264401 = 1766319049 ^ 2
Solution is (226153980, 1766319049)
